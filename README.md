# WPF_Audio-0.1
A lot of work ahead :) 

For now:
  Player finds all the songs in the specified (hardcoded for now) folder, creates necessary instances of classes (e.g. Song, Playlists, Albums), finds an album cover (if such exists), can play a song, view contents of albums,create playlists, add songs to playlists via context menu from listBoxSongs, fast forward during songs playback via slider.
  
Planned:
  Folder selection,playing next song after the chosen one has stopped playing, overall improvement of stability of app, refactoring to replace repeated fragments of code with methods, adding songs to playlists from every container of the program via context menu, adding songs to media via drag-and-drop.
  
Planned for later:
  Color schemes, integration with social media (Instagram, Twitter for instance).
