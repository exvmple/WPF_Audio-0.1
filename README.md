# WPF_Audio-0.5
A lot of work ahead :) 

For now:
      Player finds all the songs in the specified (hardcoded for now) folder and subfolders, gathers necessary information from ID3 Tags, creates necessary instances of classes (e.g. Song, Playlists, Albums), finds an album cover (if such exists), plays songs in order (repeated and random modes included), views contents of albums,creates playlists, adds songs to playlists via context menu, fast forwards during songs playback via slider or pressing prev/next button, opens a window to tweet the song you're listening to now, can share curently played song to Twitter, adds songs to media via drag-and-drop, folder selection.
  
Planned:
       improvement of stability of app (not so many problems for now but still there are some :) ), refactoring, 
  
Planned for later:
    ability to attach screenshot/album cover while posting to Twitter, ability to view lyrics of a specified song.
